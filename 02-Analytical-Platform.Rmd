## Summary of key terms
It will help you to be familiar with the following key terms:

- **Analytical Platform (AP)**: A data analysis environment providing modern tools and key datasets for MoJ analysts. AP contains training documents, resources, and access to various analytical software such as Rstudio and Jupyter.
- **Control Panel**: A place to navigate to Rstudio, Jupyter, S3 Buckets etc
- **RStudio**: Development environment for writing R code and R Shiny apps
- **JupyterLab**: Development environment for writing Python code including Python notebooks
- **Git**: Version control software that enables multiple people to make separate changes at the same time.
- **GitHub**: A web-based interface that uses Git and on which you publish and share your version-controlled code. You use Git locally (e.g. using RStudio) to track versions of your code, and then submit those changes to Github. 
- **GitHub Repositories (Repo)**: Broadly similar to setting up a project folder on DOM1 shared drive to save work and share with others. Files on Github Repos represent the definitive version of the project. Everyone who works on the project makes contributions from their own personal versions.
- **Amazon S3**: A web-based cloud storage platform for storing data. Access to amazon S3 buckets can be managed. 
- **Slack**: Collaboration tool where you can get technical support for Analytical Platform tools such as R, Python, Git. You can share knowledge, submit admin requests and communicate quickly with other AP users.
