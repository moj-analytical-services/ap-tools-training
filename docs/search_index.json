To learn more about the Analytical Platform and to get up and running, go to the Analytical Platform chapter. 1.3 Coding Mentoring Scheme If you are new to coding (in any language or in a new coding language), or if you are new to Data and Analysis directorates and your role involves coding, then it is recommended that you request a coding mentor. The purpose of the scheme is to provide a better on-the-job coding learning experience and raise awareness of the preferred ways of working that will for instance enable people to get up to speed more quickly with others’ code. The scheme is also open to non-coders who need to use the Analytical Platform to advise them through the learning process, and for those needing help with developing the reproducibility of a coding product and/or pipeline or commencing a more complex coding project. To request a coding mentor please complete the Coding Mentoring Scheme mentee form. If you would like to become a coding mentor please complete the Coding Mentoring Scheme mentor form. For more information please contact Jose Vieira or Helen Williams. 1.4 Coding Training Groups Those working in Data and Analysis directorates are recommended to take the internal training courses in R, SQL, Python and Git/GitHub as they are run using the MoJ Analytical Platform. The main introductory R, SQL and Git/GitHub sessions are usually run live in February/March, June/July and October/November each year while you can also work through R, SQL, Git/GitHub and Python sessions yourself using the training material and/or recordings. To learn more about the sessions currently available and how to access the material and recordings, go to the Coding Training Groups chapter. 1.5 Coffee and Coding The internal training (see above) is complemented by Coffee and Coding presentations. These presentations usually take the form of a demonstration of a tool or technique and/or a show and tell of work done within the department using particular coding methods. For more information go to the Coffee and Coding chapter. 1.6 Bite-sized sessions The bite-sized sessions are short sessions (generally talks of up to 15mins followed by Q/A) on a variety of topics including specialist as well as softer skills. Past topics have included: What is and isn’t meant by AI? Using MS Power Automate to reduce office tasks An introduction to the D&amp;A Coding Mentoring Scheme Introduction to nDelius derived tables New statistical methods guidance for MoJ analysts How to use the Evidence Library to support your work Prototyping - why, how and when? Key components of RAP in MoJ coding projects ChatGPT for coding - Know your Frenemy Hints and tips on public speaking What are faith and belief? You can find recordings of bite-sized sessions in the bite-sized session video library. For more information including if you are interested in presenting a session or joining the bite-sized session facilitation team please contact Aidan Mews or Edward Adams. 1.7 Learning Pathways Learning Pathways are a structured series of learning activities and resources designed to help individuals acquire specific skills and knowledge. The Introduction to Data Science Learning Pathway has been developed to equip staff with the foundational knowledge and skills they need to make a successful start as a Data Scientist. (More pathways are under development.) Who is it for? Everyone with an interest in upskilling in Data Science! The Pathway was developed with new HEOs in mind but would also suit other grades seeking a refresher or those transitioning from another profession. Python users. (A version for R users is under development.) The Pathway can be accessed through DataCamp (see the DataCamp section for more information). 1.8 Analytical Function training There are many Analytical Function training opportunities for analysts including about specialist topics not presently covered internally. Examples useful for Reproducible Analytical Pipeline practitioners include Best practice in programming – clean code and a more lengthy Introduction to unit testing than currently available internally. You can learn more about such opportunities via: The Analytical Function Learning Curriculam The Analytical Function Training Courses 1.9 DataCamp DataCamp licenses are beneficial to cover gaps in current training provision that are not currently picked up by either internal or Analytical Function training e.g. training in Power BI and more advanced or niche R, SQL, and Python skills.

For more depth please see: The Introduction to the Analytical Platform (link to recent recording), given as part of the Analysis Directorate Induction Academy. The Introduction to using R on the Analytical Platform - see the internal R training section for more details. The Analytical Platform User Guidance. 2.2 Summary of key terms It will help you to be familiar with the following key terms: Analytical Platform (AP): A data analysis environment providing modern tools and key datasets for MoJ analysts. AP contains training documents, resources, and access to various analytical software such as Rstudio and Jupyter. Control Panel: A place to navigate to Rstudio, Jupyter, S3 Buckets etc RStudio: Development environment for writing R code and R Shiny apps JupyterLab: Development environment for writing Python code including Python notebooks Git: Version control software that enables multiple people to make separate changes at the same time. GitHub: A web-based interface that uses Git and on which you publish and share your version-controlled code. You use Git locally (e.g. using RStudio) to track versions of your code, and then submit those changes to Github. GitHub Repositories (Repo): Broadly similar to setting up a project folder on DOM1 shared drive to save work and share with others. Files on Github Repos represent the definitive version of the project. Everyone who works on the project makes contributions from their own personal versions. Amazon S3: A web-based cloud storage platform for storing data. Access to amazon S3 buckets can be managed. Slack: Collaboration tool where you can get technical support for Analytical Platform tools such as R, Python, Git. You can share knowledge, submit admin requests and communicate quickly with other AP users. 2.3 Getting set up Follow the steps in the Analytical Platform User Guidance Quickstart Guide. 2.4 Managing data Once you have got set up on the Analytical Platform, do read about the following data management/handling topics in the Analytical Platform User Guidance: How data are held on the Analytical Platform and finding the data you need. You can read about the three different data storage options (Amazon S3, Curated databases and home directories). Working with Amazon S3, data FAQ, the Data Uploader tool and interacting with Amazon S3 via the Analytical Platform. Information governance procedures to be followed. Data retention policies including when deleting data means they are permanently deleted.

Coffee &amp; Coding provides a regular opportunity for people within MoJ who are interested in coding to: Share skills and knowledge Showcase their work and projects Provide advice and guidance to each other Network and get to know each other Code can be shared from any language — whether R, Python, SQL, or other more specialised languages. The format is generally 30–40 minutes for a presentation, followed by time for questions. The presentations usually take the form of a demonstration of a tool or technique and/or a show and tell of work done within the department using these methods. 4.2 Recorded presentations Where possible, Coffee and Coding presentations are recorded to allow people to catch up on talks they may have missed and to provide a useful training resource for colleagues. These recordings are available on the Coffee and Coding Sharepoint page. We regularly update the access list, but if you cannot access the videos please contact the Coffee and Coding mailbox. 4.2.1 Some useful talks If you are new to coding in MoJ, you might find the following recorded talks useful:- Ten top tips for data presentation Package management in renv Developing an Accessible and gov.uk styled dashboard The full archive of recorded talks can be found here. 4.3 Code repositories You can find code examples to go along with past Coffee and Coding presentations in our private repo (only accessible by members of the MoJ Analytical Services GitHub organisation). 4.4 Get involved! We are always looking for new presentations. If you have an idea for a talk you would like to give, or if you want to showcase a coding project you have been working on, please contact the Coffee and Coding mailbox. If you have feedback or suggestions for the Coffee and Coding team, we would love to hear from you. You can respond to our open feedback form here.
