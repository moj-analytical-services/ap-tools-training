You can view a recent recording of the Introduction to the Analytical Platform, which was given as part of the Analysis Directorate Induction Academy. Otherwise, to learn more about the Analytical Platform and to get up and running, go to the Analytical Platform chapter. More extensive information is provided by the Analytical Platform user guidance. 1.3 Coding Mentoring Scheme If you are new to coding (in any language or in a new coding language), or if you are new to Data and Analysis and your role involves coding, then it is recommended that you request a coding mentor. The purpose of the scheme is to provide a better on-the-job coding learning experience and raise awareness of the preferred D&amp;A ways of working that will for instance enable people to get up to speed more quickly with others’ code. The scheme is also open to non-coders who need to use the Analytical Platform to advise them through the learning process, and for those needing help with developing the reproducibility of a coding product and/or pipeline or commencing a more complex coding project. To request a coding mentor please complete the Coding Mentoring Scheme mentee form. If you would like to become a coding mentor please complete the Coding Mentoring Scheme mentor form. For more information please contact Jose Vieira or Helen Williams. 1.4 Coding Training Groups Those working in Data and Analysis are recommended to take the internal training courses in R, SQL, Python and Git/GitHub as they are run using the MoJ Analytical Platform. The main introductory R, SQL and Git/GitHub sessions are usually run live in February/March, June/July and October/November each year while you can also work through R, SQL, Git/GitHub and Python sessions yourself using the training material and/or recordings. To learn more about the sessions currently available and how to access the material and recordings, go to the Coding Training Groups chapter. 1.5 Coffee and Coding The internal training (see above) is complemented by Coffee and Coding presentations. These presentations usually take the form of a demonstration of a tool or technique and/or a show and tell of work done within the department using particular coding methods. For more information go to the Coffee and Coding chapter. 1.6 Bite-sized sessions The Data and Analysis bite-sized sessions are short sessions (generally talks of up to 15mins followed by Q/A) on a variety of topics including specialist as well as softer skills. Recent topics have included: Using MS Power Automate to reduce office tasks An introduction to the D&amp;A Coding Mentoring Scheme Introduction to nDelius derived tables New statistical methods guidance for MoJ analysts How to use the Evidence Library to support your work Prototyping - why, how and when? Key components of RAP in MoJ coding projects ChatGPT for coding - Know your Frenemy Hints and tips on public speaking What are faith and belief? You can find recordings of bite-sized sessions in the bite-sized session video library. For more information including if you are interested in presenting a session or joining the bite-sized session facilitation team please contact Aidan Mews or Edward Adams. 1.7 Analytical Function training There are many Analytical Function training opportunities for analysts including about specialist topics not presently covered internally. Examples useful for RAP practitioners include Best practice in programming – clean code and a more lengthy Introduction to unit testing than currently available internally. You can learn more about such opportunities via: The Analytical Function Learning Curriculam The Analytical Function Training Courses 1.8 DataCamp DataCamp licenses are beneficial to cover gaps in current training provision that are not currently picked up by either internal or Analytical Function training e.g. training in Power BI and more advanced or niche R, SQL, and Python skills.
