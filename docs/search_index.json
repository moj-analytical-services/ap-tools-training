Coffee &amp; Coding provides a regular opportunity for people within MoJ who are interested in coding to: Share skills and knowledge Showcase their work and projects Provide advice and guidance to each other Network and get to know each other Code can be shared from any language — whether R, Python, SQL, or other more specialised languages. The format is generally 30–40 minutes for a presentation, followed by time for questions. The presentations usually take the form of a demonstration of a tool or technique and/or a show and tell of work done within the department using these methods. 4.2 Recorded presentations Where possible, Coffee and Coding presentations are recorded to allow people to catch up on talks they may have missed and to provide a useful training resource for colleagues. These recordings are available on the Coffee and Coding Sharepoint page.
