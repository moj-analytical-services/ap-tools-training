# R/SQL/Git/Python Training Groups {#ITG}

Those working in Data and Analysis are recommended to take the internal training courses as they are run using the MoJ Analytical Platform and focus on topics of relevance to MoJ analysts. The main introductory R, SQL and Git/GitHub sessions are usually run live in February/March, June/July and October/November each year while you can also work through R, SQL, Git/GitHub and Python sessions yourself using the training material and/or recordings. There is also Python training you can work through yourself.  

## R Training

The following sessions are available; click on the links to view the material in the GitHub repositories. The first three are particularly recommended for new starters.   

* [Introduction: Using R on the Analytical Platform](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/intro_using_r_on_ap)
* [Introduction to R](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/IntroRTraining)
* [R Charting](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/ggplotTraining)

The recordings of these R training sessions are either available in [the new R/SQL/Git Training Video Library](https://justiceuk.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/RTrainingGroup/Ev1kwXxGaVNNpLwFg4drakUBNUpZz72DRdcD8PipkU-u9A?e=SQzeJL) or in the [old R training MS Stream Channel](https://web.microsoftstream.com/channel/aa3cda5d-99d6-4e9d-ac5e-6548dd55f52a).

## Git/GitHub Training

Whether seeking to use R, SQL or Python, it is recommended that all newcomers attend or work through themselves this [Introduction to Git/GitHub](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/intro_to_github_training) (click on link to view material in GitHub repository) session. A recording can be viewed in [the new R/SQL/Git Training Video Library](https://justiceuk.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/RTrainingGroup/Ev1kwXxGaVNNpLwFg4drakUBNUpZz72DRdcD8PipkU-u9A?e=SQzeJL).	

## SQL Training

All newcomers who are to use SQL should attend or work through themselves the [Introduction to SQL](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/sql_training) (click on link to view material in GitHub repository) session. A recording of this session is available in [the new R/SQL/Git Training Video Library](https://justiceuk.sharepoint.com/:f:/s/RTrainingGroup/Ev1kwXxGaVNNpLwFg4drakUBNUpZz72DRdcD8PipkU-u9A?e=SQzeJL)
